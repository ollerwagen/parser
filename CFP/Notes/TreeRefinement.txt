Example:

A     -> "-" A | Ident
Ident *> <char> | <char> Ident

Consider the following tree:

      A
      |
  "-"   A
        |
      Ident
        |
    "a" Ident
          |
      "b" Ident
            |
           "c"

Refine this to the following tree by opening up the *> connections

      A
      |
  "-"   A
        |
      Ident
        |
      "abc"

The relation -> means that the nonterminal only ever "sees" that string.
The relation *> means that in a refined parse tree, the nonterminal sees "through" at least one layer of nonterminals.
